# Personal-Website
A set of three pages that comprise a personal website. There is a complete "About Me" page, with a bio, links to social media and a GitHub portfolio, and a headshot. There is a contact page, with a nonfunctional form with pending Javascript code. There is an empty portfolio, with placeholder images where projects will go as they are completed.

The Site is fully formatted, with personalized CSS styling and mobile responsive margins and text.

Planned updates: form functionality, portfolio elements.
